# utils
A set of utilities for daily hacking

## Disclaimer

I created this project just to host some scripts that I use in daily (legal) hacking.
Do not expect much technical sophistication on them (you have been told).

## Dependencies

The dependencies are not managed by each script individualy but per project instead.
If you feel lazy and just want to get started, just clone this repo and run

```
poetry install
```

If you are not familiar with `poetry`, refer to their
[usage guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).


## Get Started

There is a README inside each directory with description and usage example for each tool.

## License

This project is licensed under MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.
